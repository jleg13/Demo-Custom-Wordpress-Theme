# Custom WordPress Theme

## Project Description

In this project I wanted to expand the scope of my web development skillset. Whilst taking a course on Udemy I was able to learn the core principles of using the WordPress CMS and building a dynamic custom WordPress theme from a static website. Key skills used in this project are:
  - responsive design using Bootstrap
  - Parrallax effect for images
  - WordPress development including working blog and utilising the popular plugins Anvanced Custom Fields, Custom Post Type UI and Contact Form 7
